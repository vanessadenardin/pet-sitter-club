## 3. Purpose

The purpose of the 'Pet Sitter Club' is to bring community members together to provide pet care services in your neighbourhood. Although it is simple, considering only dogs and cats as pets at home, it seeks to focus the user experience on the aspect of exchange between users (pet sitter and client through service hiring, client and client through assessments).

## 4. Problem / Solve

Increasingly, it has been noticed that many families have one or more pets. Although services that offer pet care, such as hotels or training and social adaptation schools, are in high demand, there are consumers who seek more personalized services or have animals that do not feel comfortable in environments with other animals.
For this reason, this application was developed to offer a pet sitting service to customers who choose a more personalized service or do not feel comfortable leaving their pets in a hotel during the trip, or who want special activities or training to their pets and due to workload or no experience they are not able to achieve successful results.
The application will act as an intermediary, connecting the pet sitter to the client interested in the service, considering the proximity between the clients and the pet sitters.

## 5. Target Audience
