## 3. Purpose

The purpose of 'The Pet Sitter Club' is to bring community members together to provide pet care services in your neighbourhood. Although it is simple and the market has a lot of this kind of businesses running. The idea of this project considered only dogs and cats as pets at home, it seeks to focus the user experience on the aspect of exchange between users (pet sitter and client through service hiring, client to client through reviews).

## 4. Problem / Solve

Increasingly, it has been noticed that many families have one or more pets. Although services that offer pet care, such as hotels or training and social adaptation schools, are in high demand, there are consumers who seek more personalized services or have animals that do not feel comfortable in environments with other animals.
For this reason, this application was developed to offer a pet sitting service to customers who choose a more personalized service or do not feel comfortable leaving their pets in a hotel during the trip, or who want special activities or training to their pets and due to workload or no experience they are not able to achieve successful results.
The application will act as an intermediary, connecting the pet sitter to the client interested in the service, considering the proximity between the clients and pet sitters, inspired from a similar idea of pet sitter hire Mad Paws ('https://www.madpaws.com/').

## 5. Target Audience

The target audience of this app is anyone who has a pet at home or is interested in taking care of a pet and making money from it.

## 12. ERD

The initial idea when designing the ERD diagram was to have 9 tables being the so-called `roles` that would identify the type of user of the application, which could be admin, client and pet sitter. However, after talking to the educator and carrying out some research, it was decided how to transform the table, previously related to the table `users` in the same column, keeping the name `role`.

![Initial ERD](docs/data-diagram1.png)

During the coding path, some necessary modifications were made in the nomenclature and in the associations between the tables, as shown below.

![Initial ERD](docs/data-diagram3.png)

For example, the table `services` is no longer associated with the table `users`, in its place, the table `pet_sitter_services` has been added and works as a junction table between `users` and `services`. In addition, `pet_sitter_services` is associated with the table `order_services`.

The columns were also moved between the tables to facilitate the consultation of the data, for example, the column `price` that was moved from the table `pet_sitter_services` to the table `services`.

---

## 13. High-level components (abstractions)

The Pet Sitter Club is a service market application that uses the Ruby on Rails framework. The Ruby on Rails framework is known to be a framework of choice for several market applications, as it presents abstractions that simplify the development process. The views concentrate the minimum logic of the application, the models store the data of the database and the controllers are the methods that provide the logic of the application.

The Pet Sitter Club uses several models to normalize relationships and associations in the database. Contributing to the integrity of the database.

Through the `current_user` determined by the use of Devise when a user visits the website, authorization allows the visualization components to be adequate according to the role that the user exercised when creating an account on the website. The application differentiates client accounts and pet sitters, changing the features available in each role assigned. When a user creates an account, he has to choose the client or the pet sitter role and from there access is granted.

Only the application administrator can add new services and upload an image attachment to illustrate it. Pet sitters can upload a personal image on their profile but it is not mandatory. And clients can add information about pets, including uploading a photo attachment of the animal. For this, Amazon S3 and active storage are used to facilitate the storage of attached images.

---

## 14. Third party services

Third party services used were:

- **Bootstrap:** The framework is used to stylish the pages in the application.

- **Devise:** The Ruby gem is used in the application to manage user authentication. It also provides views features, the current_user function to collaborate with authorizations and the integrity of the database.

- **Cancancan:** The Ruby gem is used for authorization in the application to restrict the accessibility of the application according to the different registered roles `admin`, `pet sitter` and `client` and also for the general public.

- **Simple Form:** The Ruby gem integrated with Bootstrap is used to create forms in HTML for some of the application pages.

- **AWS**
  - S3 Bucket It is used to upload and store images of pets, profile pictures of pet sitters and images to illustrate the services offered in the app.
  <!-- - IAM -->

- **Heroku:** The cloud platform is used for application deployment and management.

- **Github:** The platform is used for the management and storage of the application code.

A user `has_many pet_sitter_services`, a pet sitter service `belongs_to user`, as foreing key `pet_sitter_id`.

A user `has_many services`, a service `has_many pet_sitter_services` as  foreign key `service_id`.

A user `has_one_attached image`.

## 16. The database relations to be implemented

Database relationships are implemented using foreign keys in relationships that use `belongs_to` in the relationship model.


---

## 17. Database schema design

The arguments for each table also include `created_at:datetime` and` updated_at:datetime`, in addition to the table reference `table_id:bigint`.

- **Users**

```
    first_name:string
    last_name:string
    email:string
    admin:boolean
    abn:string
    about:text

## 18. Tasks allocation and tracking

[Trello board The Pet Sitter Club](#https://trello.com/b/Bobh4NxJ/pet-sitter-app)

Below are some screenshots of how the application code was developed, starting with sending the idea to the educator.

After the idea was approved, setting up a Git repository, designing the first ERD and a site map to start the coding process were the steps that followed.

<!-- nÃ£o funciona -->
![First Trello board screenshot](docs/Trello1.png)

<!-- nÃ£o funciona -->
![Trello board screenshot 2](docs/Trello2.png)

Then, the following steps were divided in order to respond to all the requirements of the evaluation respecting the sitemap and the wireframes already developed.

From there, the tasks allocated were separated by pages in the application or important methods to be implemented on each page, in addition to the layout features of each page.
